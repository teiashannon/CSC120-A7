- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I decided to stick to overloading the constructors in this assignment, because I did not feel as if any of the other methods would necessarily benefit from being overloaded for this particular assignment. I got a bit bogged down during this assignment about the different terminology (overriding vs overloading) but once I got the hang of it in one class I was easily able to transfer my knowledge to do the same thing for the other classes. I liked the ability to easily transfer methods that had already been written, as that way I knew everything would work when I debugged if it had worked originally. The advice I would give someone is to take your time moving through the assignment and to try not to get overwhelmed by the concepts.
